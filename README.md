Easily create new Flutter projects with only the platforms you wantâ€”directly from Visual Studio Code!

## Features
- **Choose platforms**: Select from Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux when creating a new Flutter project.
- **No manual cleanup**: Only the selected platforms are included in your project (using `flutter create --platforms`).
- **Simple UI**: Guided prompts for project name, location, and platforms.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install the Extension
- Clone or download this repository.
- Run `npm install` in the project root.
- Press `F5` in VS Code to launch an Extension Development Host.

### 2. Using the Extension
1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
2. Search for and run: `Flutter: New Project with Platforms`.
3. Enter your project name.
4. Select a folder for your new project.
5. Pick the platforms you want to support.
6. The extension will open a terminal and run the appropriate `flutter create` command for you.

## Requirements
- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installed and available in your system PATH.
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Dart & Flutter VS Code extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter) (recommended for Flutter development)

## Example

## Troubleshooting
- Make sure `flutter` is available in your terminal (try running `flutter --version`).
- If you see permission errors, ensure VS Code has access to the folder where you want to create the project.
